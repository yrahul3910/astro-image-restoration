1. Do the FITS files now have the true images convolved with the PSF of the telescopes?
2. If so, do we have the PSF of the telescope?
3. So are these images obtained by convolution of the true image with the PSF, and then additive noise?

Read Sharjeel's report about this...

Need more images, maybe try finding their distributions. If the above is the case, ask about deconvolution algorithms, do it and then find distributions. 

Ask about computing resources at IIA.

scipy.signal.deconvolve(signal, PSF)
