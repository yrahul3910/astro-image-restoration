# README
This readme provides an explanation of each file. All code files are properly named and documented, so this will not explain the details of the code.

* `reportSharjeel.odt`: The report by the previous student, Sharjeel.
* `ksb orig paper.pdf`: The original paper on the KSB reconstruction method.
* `internship_Report.pdf`: A report on the problem statement and some background information. This is a useful starting point, but a lot of the information is from Wikipedia/other sources.
* `harvard lensing notes.pdf`: Harvard notes on gravitational lensing. The initial slides give a helpful introduction to the concept.
* `Wozniak_DIA.pdf`: A DIA (Difference Image Analysis) method proposed by Wozniak. Not very useful, since to compute the PSF, I instead used the library that used a different algorithm ultimately.
* `Noise2Noise - Learning Image Restoration without Clean Data.pdf`: An interesting relevant paper, but not used in this project.
* `Lecture3.pdf`: Lecture slides on the KSB method. Useful because it provides information about how images get corrupted in the first place.
* `Lecture1_CH.pdf`: Another nice introductory lecture slides by the same professor as above. Contains some useful diagrams. I've incorporated these into my 'current understanding' notes.
* `Image Restoration in Astronomy A Bayesian Perspective.pdf`: An interesting paper, but I haven't gone through the details.
* `Astronomical Image Reconstruction using CNNs.pdf`: The basis for the model implemented in the 'OtherCNN' folder.
* `current understanding`: A collective summary of an introduction to the problem statement along with references where the information was taken.
* `OtherCNN`: The implementation for the other neural network proposed (3-layer). Contains the data, code to generate the noisy dataset, and the model.
* `IRCNN_impl`: Full implementation with checkpoints of trained models of the Image Restoration CNN (IRCNN) model.
* `GoodFrames`: Some non-corrupted FITS images. Useful for reference and for understanding the format.
* `BadFrames`: Some corrupted FITS images. Useful for reference and to understand what kind of corruptions may occur.
* `ASI conference`: Abstract for the conference in Kolkatta.
